# Financial Health Analysis- Parth Murdeshwar
This project used multiple linear regression to predict a company's financial health based on key indicators like revenue, profit, and debt ratios. Data was cleaned, visualized, and tested for assumptions. Backward elimination refined the model, confirming accuracy through residual plots and the White test.
